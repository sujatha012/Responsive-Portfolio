    <p><img src="assets/Images/roses.jpeg" id="about"/> Mickey Mouse turns 80 years old today, and there's not a gray hair on
        him. Sure, he's a little rounder, a little
        squatter, and he's been wearing the same clothes for decades, but all in all he looks pretty good. Sure, Mickey
        hasn't had a movie in two years (his last one went direct-to-video), but his cheerful face remains one of the
        most recognizable images in the world, even beating out Santa Claus. Disney threw a big party for the mouse's
        75th birthday, so this year's festivities will be comparatively subdued. </p>
    <p>In 1935, a young animator named Fred Moore gave Mickey his first makeover. Earlier animators had drawn the mouse
        as a series of circles, which limited his movement.</p>
    <p>Moore — who later animated Fantasia's Sorcerer's Apprentice segment — gave him a pear-shaped body, pupils, white
        gloves and a shortened nose, to make him cuter.</p>
